Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics

[18.02 Multivariable Calculus](/courses/18-02-multivariable-calculus-fall-2007)

Course Overview
---------------

This design-based subject provides a first course in energy and thermo-sciences with applications to sustainable energy-efficient architecture and building technology. No previous experience with subject matter is assumed. After taking this subject, students will understand introductory thermodynamics and heat transfer, know the leading order factors in building energy use, and have creatively employed their understanding of energy fundamentals and knowledge of building energy use in innovative building design projects. This year, the focus will be on design projects that will complement the new NSTAR/MIT {{% resource_link "650c4054-5f35-49ae-a0fd-24dac3662f90" "campus efficiency program" %}}.

Assignments and Evaluations
---------------------------

The final grade in the course will be based upon analytical homework assignments, two quizzes, design projects, and class participation weighted as follows:

### Homework

Homework will be distributed in class, and due dates announced at that time. The assignments are essential to learning the material. There will be seven assignments throughout the semester. Each student will make a short presentation on their evaluation of an advanced building that they have visited.

### Design Projects

There will be two design projects in this class. They will require creative use of the principles and information given in the course to solve a particular problem, relating to energy consumption in buildings. They will be due in Lec #17 and Lec #26, respectively.

### Exams

There will be two open book quizzes given in class (1 1/2 hour duration each). They are scheduled for Lec #13 and Lec #21, at the usual class time and location. The content of the quizzes will be discussed in the class sessions leading up to the quizzes. There will also be a three-hour long exam during the final exam period.
